# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to Advent of Code 2019.

Some goals:

- Solve the questions (duh)
- Keep the code clean (comments when applicable, using idiomatic Rust, etc...)
- Solutions should have _reasonable_ (i.e: not strictly the _best_) space and time complexity
- Solutions should run fairly quickly (on modern PCs)

Some non-goals:

- Getting on the leaderboard (timezones give people an unfair advantage, and late-night-coding isn't prime-time for me)
